       " '!Series_summary\\t\"Most organisms have an endogenous circadian clock that is synchronized to environmental signals such as light and temperature. Although circadian rhythms have been described in the nematode C. elegans at the behavioral level, these rhythms appear to be relatively non-robust. Moreover, in contrast to other animal models, no circadian transcriptional rhythms have been identified. Thus, whether this simple nematode contains a bona fide circadian clock remains an open question.\"',\n",
       " '!Series_summary\\t\"We used microarray experiments to identify light- and temperature-regulated transcriptional rhythms in C. elegans, and show that subsets of these transcripts are regulated in a circadian manner. In addition, we find that light and temperature also globally drive the expression of many genes, indicating that C. elegans exhibits systemic responses to these stimuli.\"',\n",

RNA was collected every 4 hrs during the last entrainment and the subsequent free-running days and analyzed via hybridization of Affymetrix GeneChips. L4 larvae were transferred to FUDR-containing plates to inhibit embryonic development.\"',\n",
